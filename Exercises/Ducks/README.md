### Ducky Inheritance and Scope

In Main.java, there are a series of Ducks that are instantiated, then each one is described, flies, and speaks. When you run it, you will see something is very wrong. Most are printing out incorrect information.

> Note: there is one issue that will prevent it from running that you need to fix before you see results. And no changing member variables in Duck from private to protected.

For each duck, make sure that there is a welcoming "Hi" message, and it's name, fly speed, and sound are printed correctly. As you are debugging the code, make note of what was wrong, why it was wrong and/or how it was fixed. All repairs should happen either within the class files, not in Main.

For each, indicate either that it is correct or why it was wrong and/or how it was fixed. When you are done, zip your code along with your responses and submit to Moodle.
